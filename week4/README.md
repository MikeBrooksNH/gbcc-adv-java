### Chapter 13 zyLab: Math Quiz GUI

<p>Use your solution to the Chapter 12 zyLab (Math Quiz) and create a JavaFX GUI that uses the math question classes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because this is now a GUI, there are some differences for interacting with the user</p>
<li>The "Administer Quiz" becomes obsolete</li>
<li>Grade Quiz changed to incorporate feedback immediately</li>
<li>Welcome Instructions were put on a button and displayed in a dialog</li>

<ol>Replaced the Instructions button with a menu for instructions</ol>
<ol>Exit button allows the user to exit w/o using the "X" button</ol>
